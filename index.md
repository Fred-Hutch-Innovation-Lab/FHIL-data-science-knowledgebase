# FHIL Standard Operating Procedures

This is a record of standard operating procedures (SOPs) for the Innovation Lab at Fred Hutch (FHIL). The SOPs are hosted at this GitHub repo and can be edited at any time to modify this site. It can take up to 10 minutes for changes to your site to publish after you push the changes to GitHub. 

There is already a wealth of knowledge available online and through FH resources. This site is meant to be a central hub pointing you to other resources, outlining FHIL specific workflows, and bridging the gaps where necessary. 

## Onboarding

- Join the [github team for FHIL](https://github.com/Fred-Hutch-Innovation-Lab)
    - This will give you access to template repos and code developed for FHIL workflows
- Get access to Fred Hutch's HPC via the [Sci-comp self-service portal](https://scicomp-self-service.fredhutch.org/)

## Other resources

- [Centernet](https://centernet.fredhutch.org/) Many resources and annoncements for the institution. See courses, events/talks on the calendar, HR resources, etc. 
- [FH Sciwiki](https://sciwiki.fredhutch.org/) has much more thorough discussions of many topics included here. This should be your first stop for questions.
- Use [Workday](https://wd5.myworkday.com/wday/authgwy/fhscca/login.htmld?returnTo=%2ffhscca%2fd%2fhome.htmld) to enter PTO requests. Use the Fred-hutch login
- [FH DataScience slack](https://join.slack.com/t/fhdata/signup) the link may expire over time, see the footer of the Sciwiki for an active link (hopefully).
- [Data Science Lab (DaSL)](https://hutchdatascience.org) Workshops, courses, house calls, and lots of other resources for community-oriented data science at FH. 
    - [Weekly newsletter](https://fhdata.substack.com/) Not always active, but can have cool resources
- [Openscapes](https://ocdo.fredhutch.org/programs/openscapes.html) An open-science intitiative with short cohorts of FH people. A great place to connect with other computational people at FH and learn about best practices in computational research. 
- [WILDS](https://getwilds.org/) Open source software developed at FH.
