This is a record of standard operating procedures (SOPs) for the Innovation Lab at Fred Hutch (FHIL). The SOPs are hosted at this GitHub repo and can be edited at any time to modify this site. It can take up to 10 minutes for changes to your site to publish after you push the changes to GitHub. 

This site is built with [Jekyll] using the [Just the Docs] theme and is hosted for free on [GitHub Pages] and updated by the [GitHub Pages / Actions workflow].
