# FHIL Standard Operating Procedures

This is a record of standard operating procedures (SOPs) for the Innovation Lab at Fred Hutch (FHIL). The SOPs are hosted at this GitHub repo and can be edited at any time to modify this site. It can take up to 10 minutes for changes to your site to publish after you push the changes to GitHub. 

There is already a wealth of knowledge available online and through FH resources. This site is meant to be a central hub pointing you to other resources, outlining FHIL specific workflows, and bridging the gaps where necessary. 

## Other resources

- [FH Sciwiki](https://sciwiki.fredhutch.org/) has much more thorough discussions of many topics included here. This should be your first stop for questions.
- [FH DataScience slack](https://join.slack.com/t/fhdata/signup) the link may expire over time, see the footer of the Sciwiki for an active link (hopefully).
- [Data Science Lab (DaSL)](https://hutchdatascience.org) Workshops, courses, house calls, and lots of other resources for community-oriented data science at FH. 
    - [Weekly newsletter](https://fhdata.substack.com/) Not always active, but can have cool resources
- [Openscapes](https://ocdo.fredhutch.org/programs/openscapes.html) An open-science intitiative with short cohorts of FH people. A great place to connect with other computational people at FH and learn about best practices in computational research. 
- [WILDS](https://getwilds.org/) Open source software developed at FH. 

## General learning resources

- [Data science in a box](https://datasciencebox.org/02-making-rigorous-conclusions#slides-videos-and-application-exercises) video lectures as an 'intro to data science'. Has some good introduction to modeling in R and basic stats. 
- [Open intro](https://www.openintro.org/book/os/) Lots of textbooks for stats and math. 

## Site Information

This site is built with [Jekyll] using the [Just the Docs] theme and is hosted for free on [GitHub Pages] and updated by the [GitHub Pages / Actions workflow].
