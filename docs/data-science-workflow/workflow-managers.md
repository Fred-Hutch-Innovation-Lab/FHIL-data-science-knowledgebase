# Workflow Managers

Workflow managers stich together multiple steps to create a more seemless, reproducible pipeline for data manipulation. If you find yourself regularily running certain programs/files in tandem, or you have a large number of files you want to process in a similar manner, you should consider finding or developing a pipeline for your efforts. 

Common workflow management languages include Nextflow, Snakemake, and Cromwell.

## Nf-core

Nf-core is an open-source community repository of bioinformatic workflows written in nextflow. There are many modules, subworkflows, and full workflows for many types of bioinformatic experiments. Before creating a nextflow workflow from scratch, you should see if you can leverage existing code, or find a workflow that does what you need.
