# Version Control

Version control is essential for tracking changes, collaborating with others, and maintaining reproducible workflows. You should develop a habit of regularily commiting updates to analyses. All scripts used to produce an analysis should be version tracked and ideally cloud-backed in GitHub or something similar. This will allow you to revert to:

* Revert to previous versions of an analysis
* Record failed analyses
* Test different analyses in parallel with branching
* Publish code with papers
