# General analysis project direcetory structure

See the [github template repo](https://github.com/Fred-Hutch-Innovation-Lab/analysis_project_template) for more details. The structure is inspired by the [gin-tonic](https://gin-tonic.netlify.app/standard/) project and the file naming conventions of [The Turing Way](https://book.the-turing-way.org/reproducible-research/rdm/rdm-storage#rr-rdm-storage-organisation).
