These definitions reflect my understanding of common celltypes encountered in this field. It is not necessarily true, and these direct relationships are not necessarily how cells exist in reality, but it is a mostly accurate heuristic. For convenience and consistency, you should try to use the main name of the celltype listed here (not aliases). This will make data more easily interpretable across projects.


```json
{{ site.data.celltype_DAG | jsonify }}

{% include celltype_DAG.yaml %}
